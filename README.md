# D3-Challenge
In this project I am visualizing data from a csv file inorder to create a dynamic scatter plot that adjust in real time based on the users desired X & Y axis choices. 

Technologies: HTML, D3, JAVAScript, CSS, BootStrap

1.*  Initially create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty`
2.*  Situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart
3.*  Represent each state with circle elements
4.*  Add in additional X and Y axis variables to make the chart more dynamic
5.*  Use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization
